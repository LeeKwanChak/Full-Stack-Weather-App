# Full Stack Weather App

![Weather App Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Welcome to my first programming side project â€” a full-stack Weather App built with Python and Flask.  
This web application displays the current weather and a upcoming forecast weather for any location using the OpenWeatherMap API.  
It includes a clean and responsive interface with the following key features:

- Weather-based background videos that change with current weather conditions
- Geolocation support to get the weather at your current location
- An interactive line chart showing 3-hour interval temperature forecasts with weather icons
- Weather icons that change based on weather conditions and whether it's day or night
